- **April 2025**: Eleanor Power presented some of our preliminary findings from the ENDOW project at a [NetSci Colloquium](https://netscisociety.net/events/colloquium/fg7JsObJJUyKXPZyS1FLmg/%2Feleanor-power).

- **May 2024**: We're very happy to be welcoming [Justin Weltz](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/justin-weltz) to the ENDOW team. He will be joining as an EPE and Applied Complexity Postdoctoral Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute, as part of the [Emergent Political Economies](https://www.santafe.edu/info/epe/home) program, helping to develop the network models at the core of the ENDOW project. 

- **January 2023**: We are looking for a research assistant to help on the ENDOW project this summer! The RA will compile a range of geospatial datasets to complement the data being gathered by ENDOW team members. We're supported by the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/)'s [Emergent Political Economies](https://www.santafe.edu/research/themes/emergent-political-economies) program. The RA will be based at the Santa Fe Institute, and supervised by Eleanor Power. Details on the post and submission portal can be found [here](https://santafe.edu/about/jobs/research-assistant-epe). Deadline for applications is March 31, 2023. 

- **August 2022**: We have secured additional funding for the ENDOW project! Very grateful to the Human Networks and Data Science program and the Cultural Anthropology program for [support](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2218861&HistoricalAwards=false) for further fieldwork for ENDOW. 

- **November 2020**: ENDOW team members [Eleanor Power](https://eapower.github.io/) and [Daniel Redhead](https://www.eva.mpg.de/ecology/staff/daniel-redhead.html), along with [Caterina De Bacco](https://cdebacco.com/) have been awarded a [UKRI Economic and Social Research Council](https://esrc.ukri.org/) [Research Methods Development Grant](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=ES%2FV006495%2F1) to gather an interdisciplinary team of network scientists to develop new latent network models that can deal with the messiness and noisiness of social network data -- like what we have with ENDOW!
