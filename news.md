- **May 2024**: We're very happy to be welcoming [Justin Weltz](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/justin-weltz) to the ENDOW team. He will be joining as an EPE and Applied Complexity Postdoctoral Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute, as part of the [Emergent Political Economies](https://www.santafe.edu/info/epe/home) program, helping to develop the network models at the core of the ENDOW project. 

- **January 2023**: We are looking for a research assistant to help on the ENDOW project this summer! The RA will compile a range of geospatial datasets to complement the data being gathered by ENDOW team members. We're supported by the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/)'s [Emergent Political Economies](https://www.santafe.edu/research/themes/emergent-political-economies) program.
